# Regular-Expressions
A primer on Regular Expressions using Python for examples

A regular expression (also referred to as “regex” or “regexp”), provides a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. 

A regular expression is written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor.

> Really clever “wild card” expressions for matching and parsing strings. Smart “Find” or “Search”.
