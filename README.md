# Regular-Expressions
This is Regular Expressions for beginners and intermediates in their quest. It's useful in any language and I use here Python to show some cool examples.

A regular expression (also referred to as “regex” or “regexp”), provides a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. 

A regular expression is written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor, including some word processors or programming languages.

> It's clever “wild card” expressions for matching and parsing strings. Really smart “Find” or “Search”.

### Understanding Regular Expressions! ###

- Very powerful and quite cryptic
- Fun once you understand them
- Regular expressions are a language unto themselves
- A language of “marker characters” - programming with characters
- This tool will save your day!
